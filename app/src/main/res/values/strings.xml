"Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me how you choose
Can you feel why you are in this
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room 
Cause I wanna touch you, baby 
And I wanna feel you, too 
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins 
Just me and you 
Light it up, on the run 
Lets make love, tonight 
Make it up, fall in love, try 
But you will never be alone 
I will be with you from dusk till dawn 
I will be with you from dusk till dawn 
Baby, I am right here 
I will hold you when things go wrong 
I will be with you from dusk till dawn 
I will be with you from dusk till dawn 
Baby, I am right here 
I will be with you from dusk till dawn 
Baby, I am right here 
We were shut like a jacket 
So do your zip 
We will roll down the rapids 
To find a wave that fits 
Can you feel where the wind is 
Can you feel it through 
All of the windows 
Inside this room 
Cause I wanna touch you, baby 
I wanna feel you, too 
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins 
Just me and you 
Light it up, on the run 
Lets make love tonight 
Make it up, fall in love, try 
But youll never be alone 
Ill be with you from dusk till dawn 
Ill be with you from dusk till dawn 
Baby, Im right here 
Ill hold you when things go wrong 
Ill be with you from dusk till dawn 
Ill be with you from dusk till dawn 
Baby, Im right here 
Go, give love to your body 
Its only you that can stop it 
Go, give love to your body 
Its only you that can stop it 
Go, give love to your body 
Its only you that can stop it 
Go, give love to your body 
Go, give love to your body 
But youll never be alone 
Ill be with you from dusk till dawn 
Ill be with you from dusk till dawn 
Baby, Im right here 
Ill hold you when things go wrong

"She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "baby, I just want to dance\n"
I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friends songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun 
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
With my pretty little Galway girl 
You are my pretty little Galway girl 
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool 
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room 
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool 
After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes 
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet 
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat 
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week 
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me 
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
And now weve outstayed our welcome and its closing time 
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine 
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine 
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night 
I walked her home then she took me inside 
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine 
I swear Im gonna put you in a song that I write 
About a Galway girl and a perfect night 
She played the fiddle in an Irish band 
But she fell in love with an English man 
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
Said, "baby, I just want to dance" 
My pretty little Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl, hey"

We were under, we were over
We were young and now I am older

Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes (oh)
Ten dollars was a fat stack
I d do it all again (oh)
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dads black Honda was a Maybach (oh)
"Re: Stacks" on the playback 
I d do it all again (oh) 
We were lovers on a wild ride 
Speeding for the finish line 
Come until the end of our time, yeah 
Started off as a wildfire 
Burning down the bridges to our empire 
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah 
We were high and we were sober

You are paralyzed

You’re fighting for your life 
Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah

And realize there nowhere left to run 
You feel the cold hand 
And wonder if you will ever see the sun 
You close your eyes 
And hope that this is just imagination 
Girl but all the while 
You hear a creature creeping up behind 
You are out of time 
Cause this is thriller 
Thriller night

Darkness falls across the land 
The midnight hour is close at hand 
Creatures crawl in search of blood 
To terrorize yalls neighborhood 
And whosoever shall be found 
Without the soul for getting down 
Must stand and face the hounds of hell 
And rot inside a corpses shell

See your batty getting bigger but your waist looks slimmer
And I hope I am still with you when your hair get thinner
I aint gotta work it out, I know I am onto a winner
And I love it when I see you sing a song in the mirror
When you play your favourite records where there aint no filler
Chicky-cha, chicky-chicky-cha, Sade, J Dilla
Now Im on the right track, from the train to the limo
Now were on the right track (right track), yeah
Used to know me back in college, now I got it like that
Could have got the side track, now Im back on my feet
If I hadnt achieved, would you pack up and leave
Now you scratchin on me like were Adam and Eve
Playing remix to Ignition in the back of the Jeep, ah

She know I love her even if I never say the words

And when you comin in here, Ill do you just like you like
Girl Im ready for your loving, girl I keep on falling
You my lucky number that I keep on calling
Wanna never let me go, she said she fed up of touring
Because I kiss her in the night and then I leave in the morning
I tell her one, already know she the one
Shes 22, we in Le Fountain Blu
And when shes free, you know she call on me
Then I make her take it off and pull it all on me
Playing in the sheets, dont sleep tonight
Playing R. Kelly I believe I can fly, yeah
She like the hook but she dont know the verse
She know I lover her even if I never say the words
You were something I cant replace
You made my heart work

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday Ill share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but were so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know well be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, Ill be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Sachi mohabbat shayad wohi hai
Jisme junoon hai

Par do dilon ki yaari mein bhi to

Gallan teriyan ton lagda ae yaara

Tu sab janda ae
Main chad ni sakdi tainu
Taan hi taan ungallan te
Roz nachauna ae mainu (x2)

Agle janam vich allah
Aisa khel racha ke bheje
Mainu tu bana ke bheje
Tainu main bana ke bheje

Ve fer tainu pata lagna
Kiven pitta jandae paani khara khara
Ve tu mainu chad jaana
Gallan teriyan ton lagda ae yaara

Ve methon tera mann bharya.."

"Pyaar kardi chann ve… (x4)

Je pata lagga mere dad nu
Ve bachda ni tu
Main dassan tainu
Na raati kand tapp ke tu aayi mann ve
Na raati kand tapp ke tu aayi mann ve

O meri mummy nu pasand nahiyo tu
Ve tera gora mooh main dassan tainu
Main taan vi tainu pyaar kardi chann ve
Main taan vi tainu pyaar kardi chann ve ho..

Pyaar kardi chann ve… ho… (x2)

Tere naal khadi aan
Main jadon tak mardi ni
Duniya di parwah ki
Kise ton main dardi ni (x2)

Ho Jaani tera naa ve
Kinna sohna ve
Leke aunda saah ve
Mainu tere bina hai ni hor kamm ve
Mainu tere bina hai ni hor kamm ve wo..
Mainu tere bina hai ni hor kamm ve wo..
Mainu tere bina hai ni hor kamm
Mainu hai ni…

O meri mummy nu pasand nahiyo tu
Ve tera gora mooh
Main dassan tainu
Main taan vi tainu pyaar kardi chann ve
Main taan vi tainu pyaar kardi chann ve ho..

Gallan vich badlan te taareya ‘ch rakhda ae
Mainu har vele ve tu laareya ‘ch rakhda ae
(Mainu har vele ve tu laareya ‘ch rakhda ae
Mainu har vele ve tu laareya ‘ch rakhda ae)

Gallan vich badlan te taareya ch rakhda ae
Mainu har vehe ve tu laareya ch rakhda ae
(laareya ch rakhda ae)

Je karna viah ve sudhar tu jaa ve
Chhad kudiyan ve
Jinna naal mile raati time bann ve
Jinna naal mile raati time bann ve ho..

(Mile raati time bann ve, ho..
Mile raati time bann
Mile raati…)

O meri mummy nu pasand nahiyo tu

Dekha hazaron dafa aapko
Phir beqarari kaisi hai
Sambhale sambhalta nahi ye dil
Kuch aap mein baat aisi hai

Lekar ijazat ab aap se
Saansein ye aati jaati hain
Dhoondhe se milte nahi hain hum
Bas aap hi aap baaki hain

Pal bhar na doori sahein aap se
Betaabiyan yeh kuch aur hain
Hum door hoke bhi paas hain
Nazdeekiyan yeh kuch aur hain

Dekha hazaro dafaa aapko
Phir beqarari kaisi hai
Sambhale sambhalta nahi ye dil
Kuch pyar mein baat aisi hai

Aagosh mein hai jo aapki
Aisa sukoon aur paaye kahan
Aankhen humein ye raas aa gayi
Ab hum yahan se jaaye kahan

Dekha hazaron dafa aapko
Phir beqarari kaisi hai
Sambhale sambhalta nahi ye dil
Kuch pyar mein baat aisi hai
mmm.. hmm..
Phir beqarari kaisi hai
mmm.. hmm..
Kuch pyar mein baat aisi hai "

It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on

As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing

Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
